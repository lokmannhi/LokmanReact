      React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end,
      JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is
      maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
      companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page
      or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state
      management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React
      applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing.
      React Router is an example of such a library. And also large and
      complicated applications are required to make AJAX calls to fetch or
      mutate data. You can use any library you like with React such as Axios,
      JQuery AJAX or the browser built-in window.fetch.
